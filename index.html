               <h3>"STRANGER"</h3> 

                <p>
                    As you looked into my eyes my heart began to race ... bump , bump , bump.
                    Slowly I began to give in , on cell at a time. How much longer can I 
                    withstand the electricity between us ?
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    My mind split into different silhouettes all over the room behind you , you
                    are the only one who makes me feel so naked. Sometimes that scares me more 
                    than it should , because maybe one day you will look at me and finally see 
                    that I am only half a man and you are not my first wound. 
                </p>

                <P>
                    
                    There is a noose around this neck , I am on my way to the gallows , that is 
                    why there is a smile on my face. Because even if I fall and never rise again , 
                    I would have left this world having found the one I've been searching for.
                
                </P>
