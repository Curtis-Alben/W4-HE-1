               <h3>"STRANGER"</h3> 

                <p>
                    As you looked into my eyes my heart began to race ... bump , bump , bump.
                    Slowly I began to give in , on cell at a time. How much longer can I 
                    withstand the electricity between us ?
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    My mind split into different silhouettes all over the room behind you , you
                    are the only one who makes me feel so naked. Sometimes that scares me more 
                    than it should , because maybe one day you will look at me and finally see 
                    that I am only half a man and you are not my first wound. 
                </p>

                <P>
                    
                    There is a noose around this neck , I am on my way to the gallows , that is 
                    why there is a smile on my face. Because even if I fall and never rise again , 
                    I would have left this world having found the one I've been searching for.
                
                </P>

            <h4>"DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER"</h4>
    
           <p>
            
            For a man to ponder upon the stars is for a man to ponder upon the loss of his mind.
            One foot after the other , lead me to the wilderness so that my soul may commune with 
            the cosmos. 
            
            </p>
            
        <p>
            Behind me lay ashes and bones , for they have felt the dew on the roses that grow high above 
            the water and when they laid eyes upon his glory they were killed by their very own ignorance.
            
            Hear me eagle heart , free spirit oh lovely flower in the hands of thine father. I stand before 
            the world a witness , for mine eyes have seen the glory of the lord.
            
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Do be afraid oh men of the earth , and go after your salvation with trembling fear. As you find
            his presence know that we shouted for joy before the foundation of the earth and that he loved 
            you before the world even began. 
            
        </p>
